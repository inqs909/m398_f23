You will have access to them online, but you may download and install them on your computer.\n\nR is a free statistical software program that is available for download at: https://www.r-project.org/.\nRStudio provides free and open source tools for your data analysis in R: https://www.rstudio.com/\n\n\n\n\nThis course will be working on answering question for the community partner Community Action of Ventura County. More information about the partner can be found here: https://ca-vc.org/.\n\n\n\nYou will be working in a group of 4-5 students to answer a questions that are of interest to the community partner. While there are questions of interest, your group will have free range in answering any question related to the project so long as the group can get data. The projects are listed below:\n\nClimate Change and Food Insecurity in Ventura County (CAVC)\nIdentifying potential sites for distribution of infant products (diapers) in Ventura County (CAVC)\nGeographic distribution of unvaccination rates in Ventura County\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCategory\nPercentage\n\n\n\n\nProject Plan\n10%\n\n\nLiterature Review\n10%\n\n\nDraft of Data Analysis Project Code\n10%\n\n\nWeekly Reports\n10%\n\n\nWeekly Presentations\n10%\n\n\nDraft of Report\n10%\n\n\nReflections\n10%\n\n\nFinal Report\n15%\n\n\nFinal Presentation\n15%\n\n\n\nAt the end of the quarter, course grades will be assigned according to the following scale:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA+\n98 – 100\nB+\n87 – &lt;90\nC+\n77 – &lt;80\nD+\n67 – &lt;70\n\n\n\n\nA\n93 – &lt;98\nB\n83 – &lt;87\nC\n73 – &lt;77\nD\n63 – &lt;67\nF\n&lt; 60\n\n\nA–\n90 - &lt;93\nB-\n80 – &lt;83\nC–\n70 – &lt;73\nD–\n60 – &lt;63\n\n\n\n\n\nAll assignments are submitted as groups.\n\n\nThe literature review provides the base knowledge of the topic at hand. Your task will be to read peer-reviewed articles related to topic and craft an introduction explaining what is known. The literature review will serve as the basis to what questions you will ask for the analysis.\n\n\n\nAt the end of October, you will submit a working code draft that includes the final analysis of your code. This will include the publicly-available data, cleaning scripts, descriptive statistics scripts, advance models, and final model. You will obtain feedback for the group to finalize. Your code must be well-commented to receive credit.\n\n\n\nEach Wednesday, you will provide a brief report documenting your plans and progress for the week. Your group will document what everyone is planning to code, read, and/or write. You will also report any challenges you faced in the previous week and how you will try to resolve them the upcoming week.\n\n\n\nEach Monday, your group will give a 10 minute presentation updating the class on your project’s progress. You will be presenting on anything related to your project such as: data sources, analysis, code, bugs, new ideas, challenges, and any other relevant information. Only 2 people from your group will present during the presentation. Each group member must present at least 3 times during the semester.\n\n\n\nThere will be reflective assignments related to the class and project through out the course that will be completed individually.\n\n\n\nThe Draft of Report will be a working draft of the final paper. The paper must contain an Abstract, Introduction, Methods, Data Description, Results, and Discussion sections. The paper must contain an Appendix containing detailed methods, extended tables, visuals, and code.\n\n\n\nThe final report and presentation will be the final product that your group will produce for the class. More information about the final presentation and report will come at a later date.\n\n\n\nThere will be 3 extra credit opportunities worth a total of 10% of your overall grade. (There are no make-ups for missed extra credit assignments!) More information will be provided on the extra credit assignments on a later date. Information on the extra credit can be found here.\n\n\n\n\nThe following outline may be subject to change.

Do not submit others’ work as your own. For assignments and quizzes that allow you to work with a group, only put your name on what the group submits if you genuinely contributed to the work. Work completely independently on exams, using only the materials that are indicated as allowed. Failure to observe academic honesty results in substantial penalties that can include failing the course.\nDisabilities:\nIf you are a student with a disability requesting reasonable accommodations in this course, you need to contact Disability Accommodations and Support Services (DASS) located on the second floor of Arroyo Hall, via email accommodations@csuci.edu or call 805-437-3331. All requests for reasonable accommodations require registration with DASS in advance of need: https://www.csuci.edu/dass/students/apply-for-services.htm. Faculty, students and DASS will work together regarding classroom accommodations. You are encouraged to discuss approved.\nEmergency Procedure Notice to Students:\nCSUCI is following guidelines and public orders from the California Department of Public Health and Ventura County Public Health for the COVID-19 pandemic as it pertains to CSUCI students, employees and visitors on the campus. Students are expected to adhere to all health and safety requirements as noted on the University’s Spring 2023 Semester website or they may be subject to removal from the classroom.\n\n\n\n\nThe California Faculty Association (the labor union of Lecturers, Professors, Coaches, Counselors, and Librarians across the 23 CSU campuses) is in a difficult contract dispute with California State University management. It is possible that we will call a strike or other work stoppage this term. I promise to promptly inform you of any schedule disruption. Our working conditions are your learning conditions; we seek to protect both. For further information go to www.CFAbargaining.org."

    "section": "Building a Website with Quarto",
    "text": "Building a Website with Quarto\nI highly recommend building your website using quarto, it is very simple platform where your text documents become webpages.\n\nUsing RStudio Cloud\nRStudio Cloud (rstudio.cloud/) is an excellent resource to create website. It has all the software that you will need to create a website. Before we begin, make sure to create repository as stated by in the Creating a GitHub Account (Required) section.\n\nCreating an Account\nWhen you load the website, create a free account using either your email or your CSUCI gmail account. Once you create an account, the dashboard should load with your workspace.\n\n\nCreating a Project\nOn the top-right corner, click on the “New Project” blue button, and select “New RStudio Project”. This will create a new project called “Untitled Project”. Now change the name “Untitled Project” to “Website”. This project will create the material you need to develop a website.\n\n\nCreating and Connecting an SSH Key\nIn you website project, you will need a way for the project to connect with GitHub. You can do this by generating an SSH key in RStudio Cloud and transferring it to GitHub.\nThe SSH key can be thought of as a key that will unlock your computer to transfer data. You will generate the lock and key in RStudio, and then give the key to GitHub. Afterwards, transferring files will occur securely.\nTo generate an SSH key, go to the menu bar and select “Tools”, then “Global Options”. A menu will pop-up, select “Git/SVN” from the side menu. Click on the button “Create SSH key …”. A window will pop-up, then enter a password. Then click “Create”. Another window will pop-up showing your lock and key, you can close the window immediately.\nIn a different tab, go to your github account. On the top-right corner, click on your profile and select “Settings”. This will redirect you to a different page. In the left menu, click on “SSH and GPG Keys”. In the “SSH keys” section, click on the “New SSH key” green button. A new page will pop-up that will allow you to add a key. In the “Title” section, add any title2.\nBack at RStudio Cloud, click on the “View public key” link. Copy the highlighted text. Go back to Github and paste it in the “Key” section. Lastly, click on the “Add SSH Key” green button.\nNow you can transfer file easily between RStudio and GitHub.\n\n\nCloning a Repository\nCloning a repository is the process of downloading a repository from a remote server, in this case GitHub account. This will allow you to re-download your repository if it is ever deleted.\nIn GitHub, navigate to your repository. On the top-right hand corner, click on the green button labeled “Code”. Make sure the “SSH” tab is selected and copy, or click on the double squares button, the text they provide. You should copy something that look like this:\ngit@github.com:USERNAME/USERNAME.github.io.git \nIn your RStudio Cloud Project, select the terminal tab in your console pane, usually on the left-side of the IDE. Paste the following text in the terminal tab3:\ngit clone git@github.com:USERNAME/USERNAME.github.io.git\nIt will prompt you to accept the SSH connection, type “yes”. Afterwards, it will ask you for your SSH password. Type your password. Then, it will download your repository as a folder. In the “Files” tab, you should see the newly created folder.\n\n\nMaking a Quarto Website\nFor this section, we will primarily be working in the “Terminal” Tab in RStudio. Click on the “Terminal” Tab in the “Console” Pane. The you will type the following:\ncd USERNAME.github.io\nMake sure to replace USERNAME with your user name for GitHub. The above command will change the working folder to “USERNAME.github.io”. Afterwards, you want to fill the folder with the necessary contents for making a Quarto Website. Type the following command in the terminal:\nquarto create-project . --type website\nThis will fill generate new files for your website. Next, you will need to create a “nojekyll” file that tells GitHub, not to use Jekyll. Type the following in the terminal:\ntouch .nojekyll\nNow, go to the “Files” Tab and open “_quarto.yml”. At the top of the document, you will need to add output-dir: docs under the project:, you should have something like this:\nproject:\n  type: website\n  output-dir: docs\nNow you are set to Render your website!\n\n\nRendering and Publishing a Website\nWhenever you are finished updating your website files, you will need render your website so it will update all the new content. To begin, make sure you are working in the directory (folder) containing your website files:\ncd USERNAME.github.io\nNow, you can render your website using the following command:\nquarto render\nYour website will be rendered in the docs folder. Then you will need to commit the changes using git. First type\ngit add .\nThe commit your files using the following commands:\ngit commit -m \"Updates\"\nLastly, push your updates to GitHub:\ngit push\nIt will prompt your for your password related towards you SSH key. Then it will push all the updates. GitHub will then publish your website in a few minutes. Lastly, type “USERNAME.github.io” in any browser and your website should work.\n\n\n\nUsing RStudio on Mac/Linux\nComing Soon …\n\n\nUsing RStudio on Windows\nComing Soon …"

You may also be able to use Quarto in Rstudio cloud.\nYou can install R via their website: https://www.r-project.org/.\nYou can install RStudio for free from their website: https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/\n\n\n\nR can be used as a calculator; below are a few examples:\n\n1+2\n\n[1] 3\n\n3/4\n\n[1] 0.75\n\n9*8\n\n[1] 72\n\nexp(4)\n\n[1] 54.59815\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese types of data are stored as a number in R. They may be whole numbers or contains decimal values known as double.\n\n\n\nThis type of data is stored a string of character values. They are usually surrounded by quotes in the output.\n\n\n\nThis type of data indicates TRUE or FALSE data. It is binary data.\n\n\n\nThis indicates that a value is missing or not computed. Commonly stored as NA or NaN.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR has specialized functions that can compute specific values. R functions require inputs, known as arguments, to produce a specific output.\nFor example, the log() function can be used to compute the natural logarithm of a specified input:\n\nlog(34)\n\n[1] 3.526361\n\n\nIf you want to know information about a specific function, you can use the ? operator:\n\n?log\n\nwhich will open the help tab. Notice there are 2 arguments: x and base. This means that the log() function can be extended to other base. To use common log1, specify the arguments:\n\nlog(x=34, base=10)\n\n[1] 1.531479\n\n\nNotice that I specified the arguments. You can also type this:\n\nlog(34, 10)\n\n[1] 1.531479\n\n\nwhich produces the same results. This is because R uses positions in the function to determine argument values; therefore, if the positions are correct, you do not need to specify the argument name.\nGoing back to the First Lecture example, log(34), we did not specify the base. This is because functions have default values for arguments. The help documentation tells us what arguments have defaults and do not need to be specified.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can extend the functionality of R. The tidyverse package includes a popular set of R packages for data wrangling and analysis. To install tidyverse, use the install.packages() function2:\n\ninstall.packages('tidyverse')\n\nOnce you installed the R package, you will need to load with every R session using the library() function:\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)"
