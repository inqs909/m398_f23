### Course Description

Explore an interdisciplinary mathematical, statistical, or computational research question in independent groups. With faculty mentoring, students develop their own research plans drawing on multiple disciplines and the multiple approaches to research. Students will disseminate results through a research paper and presentations on campus. In addition, students will be encouraged to identify and apply to relevant summer research programs, internships, and scholarships.

### Learning Outcomes

-   Learn the basic fundamentals of GIS and spatial analysis.
-   Develop programming skills to analyse geographical data.
-   Write the results of a statistical study and draw conclusion in reports.
-   Develop presentations for community stakeholders.

### Textbook
